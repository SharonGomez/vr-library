# VR Library

The VR library was created for MetaQuest using Unity and C#. 
This project created an environment where one could sit and read books available on cloud after reserving a table. You would be able to see the avatar of the other players who were in the library. Since the library is a no talk zone, a noticeboard open to communication is provided where one can see what other players have sent on the noticeboard. There were additional checks to check for offensive comments. The library included features like some fun features like petting cats, changing weather and avatar customization.

### Here are some recordings of the project wearing MetaQuest 2

There's a lovely cat, Sir Cocoba, welcoming you.</p>|<p align="justify"> Tables can be booked from the website, and you can read for the alloted time from a table. The table management is also handled using firebase</p>|

The library allows players to chat to one another realtime, this again is through firebase. The noticeboard chatting also has a check to avoid abusive language.</p>|

|<p align="justify">This project was made in a group of 8 as part of Trinity College Dublin. An objective of the module was that we cycle through various sections of development every week and get hands on experience in all sections as well as do peer programming. The group being so large and the constant switch between sections was a challenging experience and an interesting lesson in working in a large group and how management is an important part. This is the team, I count it a win that we are still friends after having to spend mandatory hours in closed space during a rain of assignments from different modules :).</p>|
