# VR Library

The VR library was created for MetaQuest using Unity and C#. 
This project created an environment where one could sit and read books available on cloud after reserving a table. You would be able to see the avatar of the other players who were in the library. Since the library is a no talk zone, a noticeboard open to communication is provided where one can see what other players have sent on the noticeboard. There were additional checks to check for offensive comments. The library included features like some fun features like petting cats, changing weather and avatar customization.

### Here are some recordings of the project wearing MetaQuest 2
